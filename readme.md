#kv

kv is a simple javascript ajax framework with form validator.  
  
  
I developed it for an academic exam about Web Technologies in 2009,  
so you can use it just for educational purpose ;D.  

  
It works simply, usin patterns matching to validate form fields.  
  
  
A complete example is available [here](../../../kw_archimedes_kv_optimusprime__sample)  
And if you don't want to wander within entire project, just check this: [festival.js](../kw_archimedes_kv_optimusprime__sample/WebContent/js)
